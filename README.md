# quip-whiteboard-vue

*MAJOR WORK IN PROGRESS*

This is a virtual, shared whiteboard, using [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/).  It is designed to be embedded in a Quip document.  It uses a [Quip RecordList](https://salesforce.quip.com/dev/liveapps/documentation#recordlist) to keep track of the objects in the document.

Currently supports a few shapes and free-form drawing, a few colors, and various levels of transparency.
